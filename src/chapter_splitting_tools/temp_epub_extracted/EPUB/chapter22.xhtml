    <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
    <p>&quot;Yes. It&#x27;s a pendant top, but I think it&#x27;s used for decorating fans. If so, you should ask Claude to choose a good decorative cord for you.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Thank you, Yun.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohaku happily lowered her eyebrows and accepted the amber accessory with a bush clover motif on its base.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun Onee-chan. Next is me!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes. Miu&#x27;s is a pendant, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Miu, who had been watching quietly, raised her hand and asserted.</p>
<p>I picked up the pendant that Miu had made, a sword and shield motif.</p>
<p>&quot;I see. This shape needs a little processing.&quot;</p>
<p>I confirmed the design with many grooves and patterns due to the combined design of the sword and shield, and quickly polished the pendant beautifully.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh, it&#x27;s turning into a beautiful silver! Is it finished now?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m going to do a little processing from now on.&quot;</p>
<p>I stood up, took a bottle from the laboratory&#x27;s chemical shelf, poured a dark liquid into a small container, and soaked the pendant in it.</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, eeeh!? Yun Onee-chan, what are you doing! Why are you making it dirty!?&quot;</p>
<p>Miu is screaming at the mithril pendant that has been dyed black because I soaked it in the dark liquid - [Shade Dark Green Dye] made from Shade crystal trees.</p>
<p>Kohaku was also surprised by my actions and was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&quot;No, wait! The silver color I really liked, a beautiful, holy knight-like motif, is turning into a dark knight!&quot;</p>
<p>I chuckled at Miu&#x27;s flustered words, but I didn&#x27;t stop working.</p>
<p>&quot;Using this [Shade Dark Green Dye] as an oxidizing liquid will make it beautifully black.&quot;</p>
<p>While explaining, I washed the mithril pendant dyed black with [Shade Dark Green Dye] with holy water and dried it.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, the beautiful silver color...&quot;</p>
<p>Miu was disappointed when she saw the pendant with even the fine grooves turned black, but I started polishing again.</p>
<p>Then, the blackened surface from the oxidizing liquid was polished, and the silver color of the mithril reappeared from underneath.</p>
<p>And, by leaving the black color of the oxidizing liquid in the grooves and gaps of the sword and shield&#x27;s decorations, the outlines of the decorations became clear.</p>
<p>Miu sighed in admiration at the change in the accessory.</p>
<p>&quot;Amazing... it&#x27;s getting better just by making it dirty and polishing it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s a compliment. Well, it&#x27;s done. Let&#x27;s give it a name and add some additional effects.&quot;</p>
<p>I listened to Miu&#x27;s wishes, named the accessory, and applied additional effects based on my sense.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Paladin&#x27;s Symbol [Accessory] (Weight 1)</p>
<p>DEF+3, INT+10, MIND+3 Additional Effect [ATK Addition] [ATK Bonus]</p>
<p></p>
<p><img src="images/embed0017_HD.jpg" alt="Embedded Image"/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Miu, who received the completed accessory, stared intently at the accessory she designed and shaped, and then said one word.</p>
<p>&quot;...Even though they are accessories of the same weight, Kohaku&#x27;s accessory has different performance.&quot;</p>
<p>Miu pouted her lips, looking slightly dissatisfied, and I smiled in a troubled manner.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s because of the difference between whether I sculpted it or Miu sculpted it.&quot;</p>
<p>I have the production-related senses of [Chaser] and [Production Job Know-How].</p>
<p>Even if anyone can make metal clay sculptures, they can only make them.</p>
<p>It is inevitable that performance will be better with a bonus or assist effect from a sense.</p>
<p>&quot;I told you at the beginning, it&#x27;s a souvenir.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, that&#x27;s right. Okay, it&#x27;s finished, so I&#x27;m going to brag to Luca-chan and the others now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Aren&#x27;t you going to watch Yun-san&#x27;s work until the end?&quot;</p>
<p>Before Kohaku could finish saying, &quot;Since we came all this way...&quot;, Miu ran out of the [Atelier]&#x27;s workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;Kohaku can go too. All I&#x27;m going to do after this is polish accessories endlessly, so it&#x27;ll be boring.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, thank you for your consideration. But, I want to watch a little more.&quot;</p>
<p>I was honestly happy that Kohaku, who was staring straight at me, showed interest in production-related things like that.</p>
<p>I was motivated by Miu&#x27;s joy and Kohaku&#x27;s seriousness, and I turned back to the accessories again.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, let&#x27;s make the rest quickly!&quot;</p>
<p>I polished the accessories made by Lucart, Hino, Toutobi, and Rirei to complete them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>‚óè</p>
<p></p>
<p>The stage of polishing Miu and the others&#x27; accessories, adding names and additional effects was over.</p>
<p>During that time, Kohaku had been silently concentrating and peeking at my hands, and I slowly turned around after all the work was finished.</p>
<p>&quot;Kohaku, thank you for your hard work. Wasn&#x27;t it boring to watch such a mundane task the whole time?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s not true. I think I was able to see something interesting. Yun-san, thank you for your hard work.&quot;</p>
<p>I was happy to receive Kohaku&#x27;s words of appreciation.</p>
<p>When I do production activities with Magi-san and Lily and the others, we call out to each other, but it&#x27;s a different kind of happiness when I&#x27;m told that by Kohaku, who is not a production worker but a spectator.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, I&#x27;ll show Kohaku, who stayed with me until the end, something a little special.&quot;</p>
<p>I took out the metal clay that I had been drying in the cupboard in the workshop and brought it over.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, that clay is a different color than the one we used...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Adamantite metal clay. I&#x27;ll show you the firing process now, especially for you.&quot;</p>
<p>For the past month or so, since introducing the [Magical Furnace] to [Atelier], I have been steadily challenging the ingotization of adamantite ore.</p>
<p>I succeeded in making an ingot just the other day, but I still don&#x27;t have the skill to make weapons and accessories from ingots like Magi-san.</p>
<p>If Magi-san&#x27;s method of making things is orthodox, then the way I&#x27;m going to make things from now on will be unorthodox.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, can you make accessories with adamantite metal clay?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Originally, it&#x27;s impossible. The adamantite powder won&#x27;t melt at the burning temperature of [Ectoplasm Clay], so it will collapse during combustion.&quot;</p>
<p>But - while explaining, I poured MP into the [Magical Furnace], and the flames changed to the bluish-white color when refining adamantite.</p>
<p>&quot;You need to add an extra step when making a ring with adamantite.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying that, I put the adamantite metal clay ring on a mesh stand and put it into the [Magical Furnace].</p>
<p>Heated by the bluish-white flames, the surface of the adamantite ring turned red-hot faster than the [Ectoplasm Clay] components could escape, reaching a temperature at which the powder melted and maintained its shape.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, what did you do for that extra step?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just applied [Hot Melt Powder Magma Powder], which is used for the jointing agent, to the surface of the ring in advance. Well, it was hard to find that method.&quot;</p>
<p>In this way, the surface melted and stuck together first, so it continued to maintain its shape.</p>
<p>Then, after the [Hot Melt Powder Magma Powder] was completely burned in about 5 minutes, I took out the adamantite ring and cooled it down in [Volcanic Zone Hot Oil] for cooling.</p>
<p>At this time, if the [Hot Melt Powder Magma Powder] applied to the surface remains, it will explode, so caution is required.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, is it finished with that?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No. It&#x27;s not finished yet. I&#x27;ll put it in the furnace again, hit it, and crush the fine air pores that were created when the [Ectoplasm Clay] escaped.&quot;</p>
<p>Since the rough shape of the adamantite ring is already there, after that, I put it in high heat and hit it with a [Meteorite Steel] hammer to raise the fine air pores to the surface.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, it&#x27;s finished this time, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that&#x27;s right. I guess it&#x27;s finished for now. Adamantite is hard, so it looks like it will be difficult to polish. Also, Magi-san says that decoration is also difficult.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adamant Ring [Accessory] (Weight: 2)</p>
<p>DEF+20</p>
<p></p>
<p>Adamantite is very hard and has excellent durability and physical defense.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even a simple ring has an equipment weight of 2, which is quite heavy for a metal.</p>
<p>With my current skill, I am not able to fully utilize the performance of adamantite metal.</p>
<p>The [Black Guard Ring], which was remade with [Meteorite Steel] that I gave to Taku before, has higher overall performance.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, this is about it.&quot;</p>
<p>I muttered to myself that it&#x27;s better to succeed even if it&#x27;s low quality than to fail, because you get more experience, and I put away the ring.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that&#x27;s about it. Well, let&#x27;s take a break now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, thank you. Today, you made an amber accessory for me and showed me the processing of adamantite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#x27;t have to worry about it. I can&#x27;t maintain my motivation unless I brag to people sometimes.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying that, I waved my hand and started cleaning up the tools in the [Atelier]&#x27;s workshop.</p>
<p>&quot;But, Miu missed out on something. If she had endured a little longer, she could have seen the processing of adamantite.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then, is it just a secret between the two of us?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That sounds interesting.&quot;</p>
<p>Kohaku and I smiled mischievously at each other and moved to the wooden deck facing the herb garden.</p>
<p>&quot;Rui, it&#x27;s smooth and comfortable~. Zakuro, fluffy fur~&quot;</p>
<p>When Kohaku and I went out to the wooden deck, Miu hugged Rui and Zakuro, who were sunbathing, and smiled happily.</p>
<p>However, Rui and Zakuro, who were being hugged, were resigned and let themselves be hugged with dull eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun-san, thank you for your hard work. I&#x27;ve already had tea and sweets.&quot;</p>
<p>I received words of appreciation from Lucart, who had finished touring the herb garden and was drinking the tea that Kyoko-san had poured, and Kohaku and I also took our seats.</p>
<p>&quot;Fufufu, is Kohaku&#x27;s accessory already finished?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s finished. Here, this is it.&quot;</p>
<p>At Rirei&#x27;s words, Kohaku took out the newly made accessory, and everyone peered at it.</p>
<p>&quot;Looking at Miu-san and Kohaku-san&#x27;s, I want to check mine quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...That clay becoming like that... is amazing.&quot;</p>
<p>I listened to everyone&#x27;s reactions, moistened my throat with the tea that Kyoko-san had poured, and told them that the polishing of the accessories was finished.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone&#x27;s accessories are already finished. Here...&quot;</p>
<p>I took out the beautifully polished accessories from my inventory, and everyone took their own works and exclaimed in admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;Ooh, it&#x27;s adjusted so that it&#x27;s easy to grip.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Really! Show me, show me!&quot;</p>
<p>Hino gripped an accessory like brass knuckles with thick rings connected, and Miu released Rui and Zakuro and looked around at everyone&#x27;s works with interest.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the tea and sweets that Kyoko-san had prepared, and listened to Miu and the others&#x27; stories.</p>
<p>The content of Miu and the others&#x27; stories was about their impressions of the accessories they had made, what they were going to do for the upcoming summer vacation, and which area they would like to explore next.</p>
<p>When I was listening to the story, Miu asked me a question.</p>
<p>&quot;By the way... I haven&#x27;t decided on a return gift for Yun Onee-chan today, but what would be a good return gift?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Return gift?&quot;</p>
<p>Suddenly asked a question, I tilted my head, not knowing what it was about, and Miu repeated her words.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a thank you for making the accessories! A thank you!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A thank you... I&#x27;ve already received the money in advance, so I don&#x27;t need it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Not something like that, but a return gift that can be returned more emotionally.&quot;</p>
<p>I had already received the price for the accessories, but I didn&#x27;t think there would be a thank you for the experience of making the accessories, so I looked up at the sky and thought.</p>
<p>Miu made various suggestions to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Is there any area you want to go to or any item you want? Help or escort for that search.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, there is also that kind of return gift.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought with my arms crossed.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun Onee-chan, are you perhaps being considerate?&quot;</p>
<p>Miu asked a little dissatisfied, but I denied that.</p>
<p>&quot;No, honestly, there are too many things I want to do, so I&#x27;m in trouble.&quot;</p>
<p>It would be more reliable to ask Magi-san and the others from the [Production Guild] or Shichifuku and the others from the [OSO Fishing Cooperative] for material exploration in the sea area.</p>
<p>Other things that I can ask Miu and the others to do are to collect ore necessary for practicing adamantite in the [Magical Furnace] and to have them check the usability of prototype blending items.</p>
<p>When I told them that, they smiled wryly with a slightly dumbfounded look.</p>
<p>&quot;Yun Onee-chan likes productive activities, doesn&#x27;t she? But that&#x27;s not a return gift.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh, is that so?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right! If Yun Onee-chan can make adamantite accessories, we&#x27;ll have a bigger advantage, and we&#x27;d like to ask you to be a tester for new items!&quot;</p>
<p>Lucart and the others nodded in agreement to Miu, who emphasized that, so I scratched the back of my head in a troubled manner.</p>
<p>&quot;But, I can&#x27;t think of a return gift to receive from Miu and the others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Mmm... ah, then, how about leveling up? Shouldn&#x27;t you raise the level of your combat-related sense towards OSO&#x27;s first anniversary?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? The first anniversary was around April, right?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s the semi-anniversary update counted from the beta version. The real thing is from the end of July to around August, when OSO officially started operating.&quot;</p>
<p>Miu answered my question politely.</p>
<p>&quot;I see. Certainly, it would be better to raise the level of combat-related sense for the event.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, yes. So, if we help Yun Onee-chan level up, we can give you a return gift!&quot;</p>
<p>I made a slightly reluctant expression to Miu, who invited me to an adventure with a full smile.</p>
<p>&quot;...No, I&#x27;ll refrain from that.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eeeh!? You seemed to be in the mood for it in the flow of the conversation, so why!?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because, when I think back to the places I&#x27;ve been invited to by Miu...&quot;</p>
<p>Starting with the cave where the giant centipede-type MOB appeared last year, Horia Cave where ghosts and skeletons appear that are connected to the abandoned village, and the ghost ship just the other day, I feel like there are a lot of grotesque things.</p>
<p>When I explained that, Lucart and the others also looked at Miu with slightly dumbfounded eyes.</p>
<p>&quot;In the end, it was good that I went. But... I go without that mental preparation. Besides, if it&#x27;s just leveling up, I think it&#x27;s more reliable to ask Sei Nee or Mikazuchi, or Taku and the others.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My sister&#x27;s sense of trust is low! It&#x27;s okay! Don&#x27;t worry!&quot;</p>
<p>She tried to persuade me, but the scenery of probably prioritizing newly discovered quests at the destination and making a fuss came to my mind.</p>
<p>&quot;Then, how about a joint area exploration with Taku-san and the others! Besides, since there are a lot of people, if we take turns fighting, Yun Onee-chan can have time to collect materials!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Doesn&#x27;t that cause a joint battle penalty?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s okay if you just take turns fighting in each party and don&#x27;t interfere! Please, Yun Onee-chan.&quot;</p>
<p>I sighed at Miu, who was clinging to me.</p>
<p>&quot;Okay. Then, I&#x27;ll ask you to help me level up.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Leave it to me! I&#x27;ll persuade Taku-san and the others to form a joint party! Besides, by the summer event, I&#x27;ll make Yun Onee-chan the top combat job in OSO!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, I&#x27;m not looking for that much strength...&quot;</p>
<p>When I gave Miu a glare and retorted, Lucart and the others laughed quietly at our exchange.</p>
<p>I was a little embarrassed there, so I quickly averted my gaze and took a sip of tea.</p>
<p>&quot;So, Yun Onee-chan, is there any area you want to go to? Is there any sense you want to level up or any new sense you want to acquire?&quot;</p>
<p>I was asked by Miu, and I put my hand on my chin and thought.</p>
<p>&quot;Hmm. The [Taming] sense can be grown into the higher-ranked [Tamer] at level 50, so I want to level that up. Also, I want adamantite ore, so a place where I can mine it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Okay! In that case, a place where Rui and Zakuro can move around easily is good, right! Then, I&#x27;ll ask Taku-san and the others for a joint exploration!&quot;</p>
<p>I felt like I was invited by Miu in a good way, but I think it was good that I got the opportunity to raise the level of my combat-related sense.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, let&#x27;s enjoy tea slowly now.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Yes!&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>The tea party with many girls passed peacefully.</p>
<p>And later, it was decided that Miu and Taku&#x27;s party would jointly explore the central area of the isolated island area, and I would join there as a leveling slot.</p>
