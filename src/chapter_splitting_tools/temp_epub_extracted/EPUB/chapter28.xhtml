    <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
    <p>With each stage the elevation gimmick advances, the Peryton&#x27;s attacks become more and more intense.</p>
<p>Once the elevation gimmick passed the second stage, the summoning of black figures ceased.</p>
<p>Instead, it indiscriminately fires red-black heat rays and sharp feathers over a wide area, so even if you earn hate and concentrate on the target, you often get hit by stray bullets.</p>
<p>Also—</p>
<p>&quot;Seriously, is that even allowed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>Along with a high-pitched cry, a heat ray was fired from the red-black sphere floating behind it.</p>
<p>However, its aim is not the player with the high hate value, but the surrounding field.</p>
<p>The heat ray destroyed part of the stairs inside the crater, causing tiles and rubble to fall from above, and the floating island foothold was burned into four pieces.</p>
<p>Then, the Peryton swooped down and rampaged on the narrow foothold, resulting in me, Taku, and Minuits being knocked into the lava, resulting in instant death.</p>
<p>&quot;Yunn Onee-chan, are you okay! Whoa, the lava came all the way here!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I-I&#x27;m okay. For now, I&#x27;m okay... it&#x27;s tough though.&quot;</p>
<p>Shocked by the sickening sensation of losing feeling where the lava touched, the use menu for the [Revival Potion] appeared in the darkened darkness, so I selected &quot;YES&quot;.</p>
<p>Then, when I came to, I was standing on the floating island, and Taku and the others, who had also been knocked into the lava and instantly killed, were reviving while gradually gathering particles of light.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if you&#x27;re careful, the first time you see the actions, it&#x27;s tough. I just have to be careful about the instant death points.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Also, watch your HP. You&#x27;ll fall from the follow-up attacks. --《Round High Heel》!&quot;</p>
<p>We, who had been revived with the revival potion, had the shadows swelling from our feet absorbed by the Peryton, and half of the HP we had recovered with the [Revival Potion] was taken away.</p>
<p>Also, the Peryton&#x27;s body transforms into a flock of black birds, trying to snatch players, lift them to a high position, and drop them into the lava as is, making it quite a tough battle.</p>
<p>We weave through the unstable foothold, the instant-death lava, and the Peryton&#x27;s fierce indiscriminate range attacks, raising the elevation gimmick one stage at a time.</p>
<p>In that fierce battle, we were unable to take the optimal actions and were knocked into the lava countless times, repeating revivals with revival potions.</p>
<p>And—finally, after activating the elevation gimmick five times, we could see the end of the battle with the Peryton.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone! The Peryton has an HP bar now!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alright, this is the real deal from here! Let&#x27;s go!&quot;</p>
<p>The Peryton, which had no HP until now, now has an HP bar appearing, and it has become possible to deal damage.</p>
<p>Miu and the others, who mainly focus on evasion, fight on the four divided floating islands floating in the lava, and we climb the spiral staircase and add attacks from the Peryton&#x27;s flank.</p>
<p>&quot;Here, here, we&#x27;re your opponents! --《Sol Ray》!&quot;</p>
<p>Miu and the others jump from one unstable, four-divided foothold to another, teasing the Peryton and earning damage.</p>
<p>&quot;Haaaaah──《Sonic Edge》!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Uooooooo──《Tiger Fang Cannon》!&quot;</p>
<p>Taku swings his two long swords and releases flying slash attacks, and Gantz adds attacks from a distance with a fist pressure that strikes the air.</p>
<p>The Peryton&#x27;s attacks are also fierce, and I and Miu and the others are knocked into the lava many times, and we revive each time, but now that damage is being dealt, the Peryton&#x27;s HP itself is not high.</p>
<p>Then, when the Peryton&#x27;s HP drops below 10%, a change occurs.</p>
<p>&quot;Ugh, suddenly damage isn&#x27;t going through anymore!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Damn it, it&#x27;s almost over.&quot;</p>
<p>Attacks, magic, and status ailments are all completely ineffective, and the Peryton&#x27;s attacks, which are becoming even more intense, attack us almost indiscriminately.</p>
<p>&quot;The gimmick boss aspect is still continuing!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Taku-san, check the horizontal cave where the Peryton appeared! There must be a hint there!&quot;</p>
<p>Miu raises her voice, and as we look up at the large hole that we broke when the Peryton appeared, which is the only horizontal cave facing the spiral staircase on the rock wall--that happened.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What kind of action is it this time!&quot;</p>
<p>I watch the Peryton&#x27;s movements while running up the spiral staircase with Taku and the others.</p>
<p>&quot;Yunn! Leave the Peryton to Miu-chan and the others, and look for the next gimmick!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Got it!&quot;</p>
<p>Having been called out to by Taku, I take a step onto the spiral staircase to do what I can do now.</p>
<p>Then, I see the Peryton swooping down on Miu and the others out of the corner of my eye, and I hear a scream from below and stop.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;──Kohaku! Rirei!&quot;</p>
<p>Below, as I peek out from the spiral staircase, the Peryton swoops down and lands as if slamming its hooves onto one of the four divided floating islands.</p>
<p>The floating island on which Kohaku and Rirei were riding sinks from the impact of the landing and are thrown into the lava.</p>
<p>Also, the lava ripples from the impact of hitting the floating island, and the other three floating islands also shake violently.</p>
<p>Then, the Peryton, standing leisurely on the lava, releases black waves and repels Miu and the others riding on the floating islands.</p>
<p>&quot;Kyaaaa!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;--Miu!&quot;</p>
<p>I saw Miu and the others&#x27; party being knocked into the lava and completely annihilated in a short period of time.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is bad. The target has shifted over here! The Peryton is coming!&quot;</p>
<p>Taku mutters as the Peryton raises a triumphant, high-pitched howl.</p>
<p>Until just now, Miu and the others had been earning hate to attract the Peryton, but when a player falls, the hate value is reset.</p>
<p>The reason for this is to avoid a situation like an okizeme, where the hate value remains the same immediately after reviving with a [Revival Potion] or revival skill, and they are targeted immediately.</p>
<p>Then, with Miu and the others, who had been gathering the target until just now, being annihilated, the Peryton&#x27;s awareness turns to our party, which is the other party.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>The Peryton, flapping its wings and running through the sky, chases after us as we run up the stairs.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll buy time, go on ahead!&quot;</p>
<p>Miu and the others, who were dropped into the lava, are attacking to steal the Peryton&#x27;s target after reviving on the floating island, but they have not earned enough hate to take it back.</p>
<p>For that reason, Kei stops halfway up the spiral staircase and takes a stance to intercept the Peryton.</p>
<p>&quot;Got it! I&#x27;m counting on you!&quot;</p>
<p>Mami-san was staring worriedly at Kei, who was facing the Peryton alone. We head for the horizontal cave that the Peryton opened.</p>
<p>Then, when we jump into the horizontal cave, there is a rail installed on the ground and a rotating cannon. And an old wooden box filled with special scarlet shining shells was left behind.</p>
<p>Judging from the picture drawn on the wall, the cannon is not gunpowder-based, but seems to fire shells with the explosive power of magic slammed into the hole in the rear of the cannon.</p>
<p>Somehow, that part is also fantasy.</p>
<p>However, there seems to be a gunpowder-based operation, and there is gunpowder next to the mithril shells, and a pine torch was lit on the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it telling us to finish it with this?&quot;</p>
<p>Taku reads the situation in an instant, but from below the spiral staircase, the Peryton&#x27;s high-pitched cry can be heard, and when we look down, we can see Kei collapsing.</p>
<p>&quot;Tch, it&#x27;s already chasing us!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Next, I&#x27;ll buy time! Taku and the others, prepare in the meantime! ──《Magic Bow Technique・Phantom Arrow》!&quot;</p>
<p>I stand alone on the edge of the spiral staircase and rain arrows down on the Peryton approaching from below, earning hate.</p>
<p>In that gap, Taku and the others enter the horizontal cave, Taku and Gantz push the cannon on the rails, move it, Minuits carries the shells from the wooden box, and Mami-san is preparing the magic for firing the cannon.</p>
<p>&quot;I will definitely avenge Kei! I won&#x27;t forgive it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;He just bought time, he&#x27;s properly revived with a revival potion, you know.&quot;</p>
<p>I call out to Mami-san, who has slightly glazed-over eyes, but she can&#x27;t hear me.</p>
<p>Then, as the Peryton approaches, chasing after us who have escaped to the top, I run up the spiral staircase that continues further upwards than the horizontal cave, repeating sporadic attacks on the Peryton.</p>
<p>&quot;Wait! Before that, is Yunn-chan, is Yunn-chan okay!?&quot;</p>
<p>While Taku is preparing the cannon, Minuits is staring worriedly at me, who is running up the stairs to buy time.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#x27;s fine. Yunn&#x27;s guy is abnormally focused on defense! He won&#x27;t become a wall-type tanker like Kei, but he can act as a substitute for an evasion tank.&quot;</p>
<p>While Taku is giving that evaluation, I switch my fighting style because the bow is too slow to attack the approaching Peryton.</p>
<p>&quot;Zakuro!──《Summon》《Possession》! 《Enchant》──Defense, Mind, Speed!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kyu!&quot;</p>
<p>I summon Zakuro and possess him.</p>
<p>The defense against the Peryton&#x27;s sharp feather attacks is left to Zakuro&#x27;s three tails, and I release magic sporadically.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;How about this!&quot;</p>
<p>Zakuro&#x27;s tail provides automatic defense against long-range physical attacks such as the firing of sharp feathers.</p>
<p>I endure magical attacks such as red-black heat rays by using defensive items such as [Magic Amulet Fragment].</p>
<p>Occasionally, I use a mega-potion to recover at once against attacks that graze my body.</p>
<p>Then—</p>
<p>&quot;This is bad!──《Stone Wall》!&quot;</p>
<p>The Peryton heats up its stag antlers and charges towards me.</p>
<p>I create a stone wall on the edge of the stairs and hide in its shadow.</p>
<p>Then, the Peryton&#x27;s red-hot antlers, running through the air, break through the stone wall, and the rock wall behind it is also destroyed, and smoke rises.</p>
<p>The Peryton reflexively shakes its head and attacks the shadow running down the stairs from the shadow of the destroyed stone wall.</p>
<p>That figure is caught on the Peryton&#x27;s stag antlers and thrown from the spiral staircase into the center of the volcano.</p>
<p>&quot;Yunn Onee-chan!&quot;</p>
<p>Miu and the others, who are running up the spiral staircase and chasing after us, witness the figure falling towards the lava, and Miu calls out to that figure.</p>
<p>&quot;──Too bad. It&#x27;s a decoy that combines 《Summon Little Golem》 and 《Mimicry》!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Kyu!&quot;</p>
<p>A black tail stretches out from below the Peryton, wraps around the Peryton&#x27;s body, and, borrowing the power of Zakuro&#x27;s three tails, jumps onto the Peryton&#x27;s back.</p>
<p>Magic gems with double enchantments that flashed to me as a way to utilize [Magic Gems].</p>
<p>As a byproduct, it is a decoy that combines earth magic 《Summon Little Golem》, which is a support MOB summoning skill I just learned, and the stealth skill 《Mimicry》.</p>
<p>I, who prepared the decoy doll in a one-shot deal, entered the shadow behind the wall with the stealth skill 《Shadow Dive》 and moved to that shadow when the Peryton approached.</p>
<p>If you look closely at the decoy doll me, it is an incomplete one that cannot even imitate the possessed Zakuro&#x27;s ears and tail, but even so, it was able to deceive the Peryton.</p>
<p>&quot;You dropped me into the lava so many times. I&#x27;ll definitely get you back.&quot;</p>
<p>I, riding on the Peryton&#x27;s back, fix my body with the tail of the possessed Zakuro, and hold a [Meteorite Steel] hammer used for forging and metalworking in my right hand.</p>
<p>And in my other hand, I&#x27;m holding a total metal arrow made of meteorite steel in a reverse grip.</p>
<p>&quot;First──1!&quot;</p>
<p>I press the tip of the arrow against the Peryton&#x27;s back, hit the arrow feathers with a hammer, and thrust the arrow into the depths of its body in one go.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>The Peryton, which is attacking from the sky, twists its body at the damage it receives on its back, which is a blind spot, and thrashes around to try to shake me off.</p>
<p>However, since I and the Peryton are fixed by Zakuro&#x27;s tail, it cannot shake me off well.</p>
<p>&quot;This level of thrashing! It&#x27;s still sweeter than riding Ruyi without a saddle!&quot;</p>
<p>Saying that, when I stab the second arrow into its back, the Peryton thrashes even more violently.</p>
<p>I deeply stab the third arrow into its back, and just as I take out the fourth arrow from my inventory, the Peryton tries to shake me off by ramming its back against the rock wall.</p>
<p>I release Zakuro&#x27;s binding at the last moment and continue to fall as is.</p>
<p>&quot;──《Kinesis》!&quot;</p>
<p>I use the levitation skill to reduce the momentum of the fall in succession, but the falling angle is bad, and if this continues, I will jump into the lava.</p>
<p>What saved me was Miu, who grabbed me in the air as if snatching me from the side and landed on the opposite staircase with the momentum.</p>
<p>&quot;Yunn Onee-chan, you&#x27;re being too reckless!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Ahahahaha, Miu, sorry.&quot;</p>
<p>Then, the Peryton&#x27;s hate is directed at me due to the repeated outrageous acts of stabbing arrows directly from close range, and it is also directed at Miu, who is with me.</p>
<p>&quot;Preparation for firing is complete! Aim is good!&quot;</p>
<p>Taku and the others, who have prepared the cannon in the large hole, aim at the Peryton.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;m going!──《Aero Cannon》!&quot;</p>
<p>Mami-san injects a magic compressed air cannon into the cannon, and a scarlet shell is fired from the cannon.</p>
<p>However, the Peryton dodges the shell leisurely with a single flap of its wings, and the shell is embedded in the rock wall behind it.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn&#x27;t hit. It would have been nice if it had ended with that...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yunn Onee-chan, it&#x27;s coming!&quot;</p>
<p>The Peryton&#x27;s target is still Miu, who is with me, and it creates countless red-black spheres behind it.</p>
<p>What&#x27;s coming is probably the super heat ray that has gathered the heat rays that have been released so many times.</p>
<p>&quot;Miu. If you&#x27;re with me, you&#x27;ll get caught up in it. Get away quickly!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I can&#x27;t abandon Yunn Onee-chan. Besides, I won&#x27;t make it in time even if I run...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If this continues, you&#x27;ll both be food for the super heat ray.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But, if we&#x27;re both standing to the end, it&#x27;ll be cool, right?&quot;</p>
<p>Saying that, Miu glares at the Peryton above her head.</p>
<p>&quot;Haaaaa!──《Prism Mirror》!&quot;</p>
<p>A seven-colored crystal appears on the Peryton&#x27;s line of fire.</p>
<p>《Prism Mirror》, which is an intermediate light magic, creates a rainbow-colored crystal, nullifies and reduces damage below a certain level, and reflects 10% of the damage received by the crystal.</p>
<p>&quot;──Kyuuuuuun!&quot;</p>
<p>The super heat ray fired from the Peryton collides with the rainbow-colored crystal, and fine heat rays return to the Peryton.</p>
<p>Even so, cracks spread through the crystal, and the super heat ray that could not be reduced is gradually trying to penetrate the crystal and corrode it.</p>
<p>&quot;Is it no good!&quot;</p>
<p>While I am thinking of throwing Miu away with the tail of the possessed Zakuro to escape in the worst case, Miu takes out a large jewel from the inventory.</p>
<p>&quot;Miu, that...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The [Magic Amulet Stone] that Yunn Onee-chan made with magic gems. At that time, when I tried multiple enchantments with 《Skill・Enchant》, I was given it because it was evil, and I missed the chance to return it.&quot;</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I couldn&#x27;t resist trying it out at Miu&#x27;s words, and I tried various items made with [Magic Gems].</p>
<p>At that time, I gave the completed item to Miu, but I forgot to get it back.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s an experiment to see if the [Magic Amulet Stone] that Yunn Onee-chan made can defend against that super heat ray.&quot;</p>
<p>Saying that, Miu throws the [Magic Amulet Stone] made of magic gems into the air.</p>
<p>The heat ray, which had been weakened by the 《Prism Mirror》 crystal, collides with the [Magic Amulet Stone], and the heat ray is absorbed into the magic gem, neutralizing the attack by scattering light in all directions.</p>
<p><img src="images/embed0018_HD.jpg" alt="Embedded Image"/></p>
<p>&quot;Nihhihi...Reduce it with 《Prism Mirror》 and completely seal it with the [Magic Amulet Stone]!&quot;</p>
<p>Miu is happy, but the Peryton hasn&#x27;t given up yet.</p>
<p>While preparing for the super heat ray again, it continues to move to prevent Taku and the others from aiming the cannon they are operating.</p>
<p>&quot;Enough already, just end it already!──【Explosion】!&quot;</p>
<p>The magic of 《Explosion》 is enchanted on the meteorite steel arrows that were driven into the Peryton&#x27;s back.</p>
<p>I explode the deeply stabbed meteorite steel arrows all at once, giving chain damage at close range.</p>
<p>Even if the Peryton&#x27;s remaining HP doesn&#x27;t decrease, the damage accumulates, and its movement stops when it receives a certain amount of damage or more.</p>
<p>&quot;Now&#x27;s the time, goooooooo!&quot;</p>
<p>Without missing that gap, the scarlet shell is fired from Taku and the others&#x27; cannon, plunges into the Peryton&#x27;s torso, and slams it against the rock wall behind it.</p>
<p>&quot;Kyu──&quot;</p>
<p>Along with a short cry, the remaining HP that could never be shaved off becomes zero, and it falls from the slammed rock wall and disappears into the lava.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s finally over...&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s right. Ah, I used the revival potion more than 5 times. Big deficit~&quot;</p>
<p>Me and Miu see off the Peryton&#x27;s figure falling into the lava and lean our backs against the rock wall of the crater.</p>
<p>We laugh as if we&#x27;re crazy at the relief that the battle with the gimmick boss Peryton is over and the large expenses due to overuse of revival potions.</p>
