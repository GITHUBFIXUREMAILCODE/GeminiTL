    <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
    <p>Understanding that these regularly aligned stones were the bones of a massive whale, I distanced myself from the bones lining the seabed to confirm their size.</p>
<p>However, even with the light-emitting creatures and the night vision capabilities of 【Eye of the Sky】, I couldn&#x27;t see to the end of the line of bones, and I couldn&#x27;t fully grasp their size.</p>
<p>We had drunk 【Underwater Breathing】 potions, but we were starting to run out of breath.</p>
<p>As we gradually began to feel breathless, Emili and Leticia found something.</p>
<p>Near the skull of the giant whale, they discovered what appeared to be underwater ruins. Emili and Leticia got off Uzuki, and I and Bell each took their hands, guiding them into the ruins.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the underwater ruins, there was a wall of air preventing seawater from entering. Passing through this wall and entering the interior, we found it filled with air, allowing us to catch our breath.</p>
<p>&quot;Haa, haa, this is... ruins?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I&#x27;m tired.&quot;</p>
<p>I and Emili slumped down near the entrance, looking around.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Leticia, seeing the crabs that Bell had been collecting earlier, had her eyes shining with an enthusiasm that betrayed no fatigue.</p>
<p>&quot;Surely, this massive amount of shellfish is treasure!&quot;</p>
<p>Leticia&#x27;s words, which could be taken as either serious or joking, brought wry smiles to everyone&#x27;s faces.</p>
<p>&quot;Still, since there are ruins like this underwater, the treasure must be deeper inside, right?&quot;</p>
<p>For some reason, it reminded me of the lake ruins from last year&#x27;s camping event and the 【Pirate King&#x27;s Treasure】 mystery-solving ruins on the isolated island.</p>
<p>&quot;I wonder if the quest or building creators are the same... It reminds me of similar ruins from before.&quot;</p>
<p>I muttered, wondering if I was ruining the atmosphere of the underwater ruins a bit, but Emili answered with a wry smile.</p>
<p>&quot;Things like that tend to leave a mark, so you might be right, Yun, about them having the same creator. Shall we proceed, then?&quot;</p>
<p>With Leticia&#x27;s excitement over the shellfish, the center of this party, having calmed down, we proceeded deeper into the ruins.</p>
<p>However, the ruins weren&#x27;t that large, consisting of only two rooms: the entrance and a room at the back.</p>
<p>And in the back room, a mural was painted on the wall in front, and a treasure chest was placed on a pedestal.</p>
<p>&quot;A mural, is it? It&#x27;s a beautiful painting.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll take a screenshot of it too.&quot;</p>
<p>I and Leticia took screenshots of the mural.</p>
<p>The mural depicted two white whales, one large and one small, swimming leisurely, with a small boat nearby.</p>
<p>&quot;Is this the whale from earlier, I wonder?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;What do you mean, Yun?&quot;</p>
<p>When Emili asked about my mutterings, I took out the bone I had dug out of the sand earlier.</p>
<p>Emili took a serious stance to listen, so I explained the material I had taken out and its flavor text.</p>
<p>&quot;I see. Those aligned stones are the grave of a giant whale, and this is a ruin to commemorate it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Probably, I think.&quot;</p>
<p>However, it was just speculation, so I wasn&#x27;t very confident.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, it could be useful as a material, so I want to collect some more whale bones.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll go get some. About ten should be enough?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#x27;ll go catch some more crabs too.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I&#x27;ll leave it to you,&quot; Emili said with a smile, sending I and Bell off.</p>
<p>I relied on the 【Eye of the Sky】 and the 【Discernment】 skill to sift through the sand and find the bones of the Great White Whale.</p>
<p>Bell, in addition to the shellfish gathered on the bones, used a crowbar to scrape off chunks of barnacles attached to the bones and collected them.</p>
<p>&quot;We&#x27;re back—what&#x27;s wrong? Haven&#x27;t you opened the treasure chest yet?&quot;</p>
<p>When I and Bell finished collecting materials and returned to the underwater ruins, Emili and Leticia were waiting without opening the treasure chest.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, we were wondering what to do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Huh? Is there some kind of problem?&quot;</p>
<p>When I asked, tilting my head, it seemed that Emili had been considering various things about the mural.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as this mural goes, there are two whales. If the larger whale is the one whose bones were sunk outside the ruins, then the question becomes, where is the other whale?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If we open this treasure chest, maybe that smaller whale will appear?&quot;</p>
<p>I and Bell made sounds of understanding.</p>
<p>Perhaps obtaining the 【Pirate King&#x27;s Treasure】 would be the trigger for a boss battle, they thought.</p>
<p>Because I and Bell were outside the ruins collecting materials, they had waited to open the treasure chest, which could potentially trigger a boss battle.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#x27;s no option to give up on the treasure chest, so I think we should prepare for battle and open it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Or rather, Leticia, do you think we can safely return to the surface from here?&quot;</p>
<p>Bell&#x27;s point silenced I, Emili, and Leticia as we stared at the whirlpool visible from the entrance of the underwater ruins.</p>
<p>The whirlpool was swirling downwards, as if swallowing everything, and if we avoided the whirlpool and tried to surface, we would be attacked by many aquatic MOBs.</p>
<p>It felt more difficult to surface than to head towards the seabed by pushing through the whirlpool.</p>
<p>&quot;W-Well... we can just log out and log back in.&quot;</p>
<p>At Emili&#x27;s suggestion, we decided to use that method as a last resort.</p>
<p>&quot;Anyway, let&#x27;s go as far as we can. Now, I&#x27;ll open the treasure chest.&quot;</p>
<p>Leticia, holding the 【Pirate King&#x27;s Treasure Map】 No. 28, opened the treasure chest.</p>
<p>Inside the treasure chest was a white flute made of a bone-like material, which Leticia took in her hand.</p>
<p>We stayed on guard, preparing for the possibility of a battle starting, but nothing happened.</p>
<p>&quot;That&#x27;s all, then. For now, please look at this.&quot;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Sea Beast Throat Flute 【Item】</p>
<p></p>
<p>Can randomly summon sea beasts and cooperate with them, limited to the 【Sea Area】.</p>
<p>&#x27;This is my 28th treasure. It&#x27;s a flute that mimics the voices of the interesting friends I met during my great voyage. When you blow this towards the sea, it will remind you of the fun memories with my friends. Let&#x27;s bury this in the grave of that friend.&#x27;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Reading the stats of the 【Pirate King&#x27;s Treasure】 that Leticia showed us and its flavor text, we understood that the Pirate King and the giant whale sunk in the seabed were friends.</p>
<p>&quot;I see, so that&#x27;s why the whale and the boat were drawn together.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s nice to have such heartwarming settings, isn&#x27;t it?&quot;</p>
<p>The fun and somewhat sad story of the whale&#x27;s mausoleum made I and Emili gaze at the mural again, and a different kind of emotion welled up.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Leticia! Since we&#x27;re here, try playing it!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Understood. Here I go.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking a deep breath, she put the flute to her lips and blew, and a soothing tone, &quot;Quo-quo,&quot; resonated.</p>
<p>&quot;This sound is nice, isn&#x27;t it? It&#x27;s healing.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes. I want to hear it with the gentle sound of water.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Nyaa~, it&#x27;s a good sound~&quot;</p>
<p>As I, Emili, and Bell were being healed by the sound of the flute Leticia was playing, a sharp, unpleasant sound echoed around us, and Leticia stopped playing the flute.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, somehow, the sea has become quiet. Could it be...&quot;</p>
<p>The whirlpool that had been visible from the entrance of the underwater ruins disappeared, cracks ran through the interior of the ruins, and flooding began.</p>
<p>&quot;Was blowing the flute the trigger, rather than opening the treasure chest?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No, no, there&#x27;s no time to say such leisurely things—&quot;</p>
<p>Just as I raised my voice, the underwater ruins collapsed, seawater rushed in all at once, and we were swept away.</p>
<p>The 【Underwater Breathing】 potion&#x27;s effect was still active, but Emili and Leticia didn&#x27;t have 【Swimming】 skill, so they couldn&#x27;t resist the flow of the seawater.</p>
<p>I grabbed Leticia, and Bell grabbed Emili, and we looked around.</p>
<p>(If the whirlpool is gone, we can grab onto Uzuki and surface!)</p>
<p>I looked around for the water dragon Uzuki, and felt my body slowly floating upwards.</p>
<p>(Wh-What is this!?)</p>
<p>We were being swept towards the point where the whirlpool had been, and I saw fine bubbles vigorously rising towards the surface.</p>
<p>(The seawater is spouting upwards!?)</p>
<p>We were pushed by the flow of the seawater and vigorously floated to the surface.</p>
<p>The force caused me to lose my grip on Leticia&#x27;s hand, and the surface of the sea rapidly approached.</p>
<p>And—</p>
<p>&quot;Uwaah...&quot;</p>
<p>We were launched dozens of meters into the air from the surface of the sea by the vigorously spouting seawater.</p>
<p>Looking around as we were thrown into the air, the dim clouds and rain that had been spreading around the whirlpool had disappeared, and a clear sky that allowed us to see as far as the distant horizon was spreading out.</p>
<p>&quot;—Beautiful.&quot;</p>
<p>As we gazed at the ocean view from above, captivated, the upward momentum suddenly stopped, and we began to fall.</p>
<p><img src="images/embed0015_HD.jpg" alt="Embedded Image"/></p>
<p>&quot; &quot;—Kyaaaaaaaah!&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>Screams rose at the increasingly accelerating speed of the fall from the air.</p>
<p>&quot;—《Zone Kinesis》!&quot;</p>
<p>I recognized Leticia and the others and used my telekinetic skill, trying to suppress the impact of the collision with the sea surface.</p>
<p>However, the telekinetic skill, used in small bursts, couldn&#x27;t completely kill the momentum of the fall, and the sea surface drew near.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes tightly, thinking it was the end.</p>
<p>But there was something that gently caught us from below.</p>
<p>&quot;...It doesn&#x27;t hurt.&quot;</p>
<p>I noticed that there hadn&#x27;t been the sea surface collision I had expected, and cautiously opened my eyes to see the seawater spouting up from below gently catching us.</p>
<p>Then, as the force of the seawater slowly weakened and we approached the surface, a huge creature emerged, lifting the seawater.</p>
<p>&quot;Is that a pure white whale?&quot;</p>
<p>The pillar of spouting seawater—it was like the tide spouted by the ultra-dreadnought MOB, the Great White Whale.</p>
<p>We slowly descended from the whale&#x27;s spout of water onto its back.</p>
<p>&quot;I never expected the other whale to appear in this form,&quot;</p>
<p>Emili muttered, looking tired, and when she looked up at the sky, the dark clouds had cleared, the tide spouted by the whale was falling like a fine mist, and a rainbow was stretched across the sky.</p>
<p>&#x27;Kwoooooooon&#x27;</p>
<p>&#x27;Kyoooooon!&#x27;</p>
<p>The Great White Whale, carrying us, made a pleasant cry, and the water dragon Uzuki, which had belatedly appeared from the surface of the sea, stretched its neck and cried out to us on the whale&#x27;s back.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, it&#x27;s Uzuki! We&#x27;re safe!&quot;</p>
<p>Next to Leticia, who was waving her hand as she said that, Bell was prostrating himself on the back of the Great White Whale, reveling in its body.</p>
<p>&quot;Ah, to ride on the back of a giant whale, one of my childhood dreams has come true~&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You really look happy.&quot;</p>
<p>I and Emili smiled as we watched the scene with Leticia and Bell.</p>
<p>Then, around the Great White Whale, aquatic MOBs that could be ridden, such as orcas and dolphins, appeared one after another, running alongside the Great White Whale carrying us.</p>
<p>&quot;Are these the ones that can be summoned with the 【Sea Beast Throat Flute】?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe. It&#x27;s random, so there might be all sorts of them.&quot;</p>
<p>For a while, we enjoyed a pleasure cruise around the isolated island on the back of the giant whale.</p>
<p>When Leticia played the flute in response to the whale&#x27;s cry, the whale responded, and the pleasant ensemble with the whale filled us with a calm feeling.</p>
<p>Occasionally, the whale spouted a high tide, and we captured the scene of a rainbow arching over the isolated island in screenshots, showing them to each other and laughing.</p>
